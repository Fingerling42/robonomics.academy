## About the course

Discover how a civilian air quality monitoring network can work and the benefits of a decentralized solution for monitoring air quality in your home or community.

## What is Decentralized Sensors Network?

The Sensors Network from Robonomics is a civilian air quality monitoring network. Anyone can assemble their own sensor or use an off-the-shelf solution from the development team and set it up in their home. The sensor network uses open source software and open component wiring diagrams. In particular, one of the main sensors used is the PM10 and PM2.5 fine particle sensor.


## What is PM10 and PM2.5?

PM10 is a particle of a substance 10 microns or smaller, PM2.5 is a particle 2.5 microns in diameter or smaller. They constantly float in the air and do not settle due to their small size (for comparison, the thickness of a human hair is 100 microns). These particles can appear for a variety of reasons, including industrial processes associated with the handling of bulk materials or the combustion and processing of minerals. They are also emitted after forest fires and dust storms. In addition, they can come from conventional transport when burning fuel or from wear and tear on tires and pavement. Car tires are wiped out into fine crumbs and the wind blows them from the roads all over the city.

## Why Do We Need to Measure Them?

PM10 and PM2.5 are the most dangerous because their size allows them to penetrate peopleâ€™s lungs, whereas larger particles tend to be trapped in the nose or throat. Larger PM10 particles irritate the airways, nose, throat, and eyes. Particles smaller than 2.5 microns can penetrate deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream. The effects of these particles on the human body can be devastating:

<li>allergic reactions</li>
<li>bacterial and fungal infections</li>
<li>cancer</li>
<li>mucous membrane irritation</li>
<li>exacerbation of respiratory symptoms</li>

## Why Decentralized Sensors Network?

There are public monitoring networks such as German project [sensor.community](https://sensor.community), but they use the usual client-server architecture, which in this case is a drawback. Data from all sensors along with user requests all are sent to one server, which cannot always handle such load. So there are situations when the map with data is not available at the most important moments.

With Robonomics Network, sensors send data to several different servers, and any user can bring up the Sensors Connectivity server for their sensor and see it on the map. The map itself is not overloaded because it is a decentralized application (dapp) that works directly from your browser with the data that the servers send to the IPFS pub-sub channel.
