<RoboAcademyText>Last time, we went through the process of installing and connecting various smart devices on the demo stand. In a real apartment or house, of course, there will be its own characteristics. When working with electricity, you must follow safety precautions and do not work if you do not know what you are doing.

Now let's move on to the most interesting thing, for the sake of which it was necessary to change the switches and install sensors in the premises.</RoboAcademyText>

**Home automation involves the use of technology and smart devices to control and automate various functions in the home. Here are some examples of home automation:**

* *Smart Lighting*: You can control and automate lighting using smart bulbs or switches. This allows you to turn the light on and off, adjust the brightness, change colors.
* *Climate Control*: Smart thermostats let you control the temperature in your home remotely. With them, you can adjust the settings according to your schedule and optimize your energy consumption.
* *Security Systems*: Home automation can include security features such as smart locks, video intercoms, surveillance cameras, or even simple motion sensors. These devices allow you to control access to your home from anywhere in the world.
* *Home appliance control*: With smart plugs, you can automate the operation of household appliances and electronic devices. For example, you can schedule the coffee maker to turn on so that it starts brewing before you wake up.
* *Entertainment systems*: audio and video systems will fit perfectly into home automation. You can, for example, set up music playback according to an event or schedule.

**Now let's discuss some of the pros and cons of home automation in general.**

Pros:

* *Convenience*: Home automation is primarily designed to save you from routine activities that are performed daily.
* *Energy Efficiency*: It all starts with taking into account the main consumers of electricity. Having statistics on hand, you can set up a schedule or be more conscious about using certain devices.
* *Improved Security*: You can monitor your home and get notified in case of any suspicious activity.
Customization and Integration: Home automation systems are often flexible and can be customized to suit your specific needs. They can also integrate with other smart devices, providing seamless control and automation of various systems.

Cons:

* *Cost*: The initial cost of acquiring and configuring devices can be relatively high, especially for complex systems.
* *Complexity*: Installing and configuring home automation systems can be a complex task that requires technical knowledge and troubleshooting skills.
* *Privacy and security risks*: Connected devices may be vulnerable to hacking or unauthorized access, which may compromise your privacy and security. It's important to follow security best practices and keep your devices up to date.

Overall, home automation offers many benefits in terms of convenience, energy efficiency, and security. However, it is worth thinking in advance about the technical base of the devices, on what protocol they will work and how to organize their connection to each other.

Returning to our smart home demo stand, let's see a few basic automations in action.

## Curtain Control

By connecting the curtain open/close mechanism to the home server, you can control the curtains from the application. But the most important thing is that now you can set up a schedule or link your alarm clock with the opening of the curtains. Waking up from natural light is considered auspicious!

## Door sensor and Light

<LessonVideo :videos="[{src: 'https://crustipfs.info/ipfs/QmR1WHAAdmPxSP2neFV8VhqFShbeVaYUsNLQ7n9Exh3JUz', type: 'webm'}]" cover="smart-home-intro/assembling-smart-home-board-1.png" />

One of the simplest automations is turning on the light by a door opening sensor. It can be useful in the pantry, where you do not need to constantly be. So, when you open the door, the light will turn on automatically, and when you finish your business and close the door, the light will not shine just like that.

## Leak sensor and Smart Valve

<LessonVideo :videos="[{src: 'https://crustipfs.info/ipfs/QmVEdwbE1wagebNybfneGKWpAPp3fyXBNnFRt2vduyMSCP', type: 'webm'}]" cover="smart-home-intro/assembling-smart-home-board-1.png" />

Knowing that you have a leak is half the battle. Forewarned is forearmed, as they say. But if you link the sensor and the valve, all the necessary measures to prevent the flood will be taken even before you have time to get scared.

## Motion sensor and Light

Perhaps the most obvious use of a motion sensor is to turn on lights. Such automations can be configured in the toilet or in the hallway

## Demo Stand Statistics

During the work of the stand, we managed to collect the following statistics

|Statistics|
|--------------------------|--------|
| Total transactions       | 6557   |
| Users                    | 16     |
| Logins                   | 50     |
| Pinned files in IPFS     | 58     |
| Data in IPFS             | 980 Mb |

[By default](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/recorder/), Home Assistant only keeps a history of 10 days. Robonomics integration, if the subscription is [activated](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/rws-activate), uploads the history every 10 minutes. Thus, you do not need to think about additional backups of your history. For example, below are several graphs of history from sensors

Finishing a series of articles about the stand and automation, I would like to say that the possibilities of the proposed system are not limited to this. Specific automation scenarios will depend on the specific case and the tenant, because everything is done for the convenience of home life.
