  "Changing your country of residence always brings not only new opportunities, but also challenges. It so happened that in my case, the new country was Cyprus, where I came to build a company. For the last 10 years before moving, I lived in a big city, where I get used to certain benefits in the form of central heating from the city, hot water supply, and cheap electricity. In Cyprus, each house and each apartment is much more autonomous in terms of life support, but concerns about maintaining a comfortable life fall on the owner. Take hot water, for example. In the cold months, you have to turn on the boiler yourself to heat it up. The apartment also needs to be heated by yourself. In winter we turn on/off the thermal blanket and boiler, and in summer the air conditioner and mosquito repellent. This requires not only time and energy, but also money.": "改变居住国家总是带来新的机遇，也带来挑战。在我的情况下，新的国家是塞浦路斯，我来这里建立公司。在搬迁前的最后10年，我住在一个大城市，那里有市政中央供暖、热水供应和廉价电力等一些特定的好处。在塞浦路斯，每栋房子和每间公寓在生活支持方面更加自治，但保持舒适生活的担忧落在业主身上。以热水为例。在寒冷的月份，你必须自己打开锅炉加热。公寓也需要自己加热。冬天我们打开/关闭电热毯和锅炉，夏天打开空调和驱蚊器。这不仅需要时间和精力，还需要金钱。",
  "My first winter in Cyprus resulted in astronomical electricity bills. This was a serious blow to my budget. One possible solution: change your habits and adapt to new conditions. But after moving, you will already have enough worries. As an engineer, I started looking for solutions that would help me control costs and make my life more comfortable, and I want to share my experience with you.": "我在塞浦路斯的第一个冬天导致了天价的电费账单。这对我的预算是一个严重打击。一个可能的解决方案：改变习惯，适应新的条件。但搬迁后，你已经有足够多的烦恼了。作为一名工程师，我开始寻找能帮助我控制成本并让我的生活更舒适的解决方案，并且我想与你分享我的经验。",
  "## Hardware Choosing": "## 硬件选择",
  "The first thing I want to start with is choosing an ecosystem. Wired systems are immediately eliminated, as they require large budgets and serious intervention in the infrastructure of the apartment/house. Of the wireless devices, there are a huge number of devices under the Sonoff and Tyua brands, but they all work via the Internet, which does not always work reliably on the island. This is not to mention the issue of privacy and safety of your personal data on other company’s servers. I recommend building your smart home with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) as a main home server. Pros: can work without access to the external Internet; it is possible to take it with you when moving and deploy it in a new place without losing the settings; supports a huge number of devices, including smart TVs, vacuum cleaners, and much more.": "我想要开始的第一件事是选择一个生态系统。有线系统立即被排除在外，因为它们需要大量的预算和对公寓/房屋基础设施的严重干预。在无线设备中，有许多Sonoff和Tyua品牌的设备，但它们都通过互联网工作，在岛上并不总是可靠。更不用说在其他公司服务器上的个人数据的隐私和安全问题。我建议使用[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io)作为主要家庭服务器构建您的智能家居。优点：可以在没有外部互联网访问的情况下工作；可以在搬家时带走并在新地方部署而不会丢失设置；支持大量设备，包括智能电视、吸尘器等等。",
  "The most popular protocols for wireless connection of devices are Wi-Fi, Zigbee, Bluetooth. In one apartment, all three types of connections can be found at once, but as for devices that make smart things out of ordinary things, it is more convenient to work with the Zigbee protocol. In this case, we do not need to worry about their addresses and coverage area, plus they can be battery operated. Wi-Fi devices require a constant connection to power and are dependent on the strength of the Wi-Fi signal. Even in a small apartment, where there are a couple of walls between the router and your bedroom, sometimes you have to install a Wi-Fi Extender. In the case of Zigbee, the devices themselves act as repeaters.": "用于设备无线连接的最流行的协议是Wi-Fi、Zigbee、蓝牙。在一个公寓中，这三种连接类型可能同时存在，但对于将普通设备变成智能设备的设备来说，使用Zigbee协议更加方便。在这种情况下，我们不需要担心它们的地址和覆盖范围，而且它们可以使用电池。Wi-Fi设备需要持续的电源连接，并且依赖于Wi-Fi信号的强度。即使在一个小公寓中，在路由器和卧室之间有几堵墙的情况下，有时也必须安装Wi-Fi Extender。在Zigbee的情况下，设备本身充当中继器。",
  "Returning to Cyprus, my required minimum of devices turned out to be as follows:": "回到塞浦路斯，我所需的最低设备数量如下：",
  "## Computer - Home Server": "## 计算机 - ���庭服务器",
  "The ultimate task for the server is to serve a smart home controlled by Home Assistant. The easiest way is to take the already preconfigured [Home Assistant Green](https://www.home-assistant.io/green/). Cost [€70 excluding tax](https://thepihut.com/products/home-assistant-green).": "服务器的终极任务是为由Home Assistant控制的智能家居提供服务。最简单的方法是使用已经预配置的[Home Assistant Green](https://www.home-assistant.io/green/)。成本为[€70不含税](https://thepihut.com/products/home-assistant-green)。",
  "The option is a little more advanced, but you can even have control over the operating system, this is to find/buy [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com). Cost [€90 excluding tax](https://https://thepihut.com/products/raspberry-pi-5-starter-kit). The [Installation](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/) page has many options to suit all tastes.": "这个选项稍微复杂一些，但你甚至可以控制操作系统，这就是找/购买[Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com)。成本为[€90不含税](https://https://thepihut.com/products/raspberry-pi-5-starter-kit)。[安装](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/)页面有许多选项适合所有口味。",
  "As a Zigbee Coordinator we take [Sonoff Zigbee Dongle P or E](https://sonoff.tech/product/gateway-and-sensors/sonoff-zigbee-3-0-usb-dongle-plus-p/), they are practically always available on the island. Cost about [€35](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/dp/B09KXTCMSC/). You can also choose a stick from [this list](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/guide/adapters/).": "作为Zigbee协调器，我们选择[Sonoff Zigbee Dongle P或E](https://sonoff.tech/product/gateway-and-sensors/sonoff-zigbee-3-0-usb-dongle-plus-p/)，它们几乎总是在岛上可用。成本约为[€35](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/dp/B09KXTCMSC/)。您还可以从[此列表](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/guide/adapters/)中选择一个棒。",
  "I highly recommend assigning a static local IP address for your home server. If it is not possible to get into the router settings, then you can additionally install a second router (I have [MikroTik](https://mikrotik.com/product/hap_ax2), approximately [€80](https://www.mstronics.com/c/337_1345_485/networking-devices-routers.html?filter_id=154)), and configure the Internet on it. And in general, it is better for all smart Wi-Fi devices to assign a static IP. This is often important for Home Assistant integrations to work properly.": "我强烈建议为您的家庭服务器分配一个静态本地IP地址。如果无法进入路由器设置，则可以额外安装第二个路由器（我有[MikroTik](https://mikrotik.com/product/hap_ax2)，约[€80](https://www.mstronics.com/c/337_1345_485/networking-devices-routers.html?filter_id=154)），并在其上配置互联网。总的来说，最好为所有智能Wi-Fi设备分配静态IP。这通常对Home Assistant集成正常工作很重要。",
  "## Boiler Switch": "## 锅炉开关",
  "The boiler consumes 3-3.5 kWh and a regular smart switch will not work. When choosing, be sure to pay attention to the permissible current; it should be at least 16A, and preferably 20A. It’s difficult to quickly find a Zigbee switch on the island itself, I ordered from [China](https://vi.aliexpress.com/item/1005006833309900.html), it cost about €20.": "锅炉消耗3-3.5千瓦时，普通的智能开关无法使用。在选择时，请务必注意允许的电流；它应至少为16A，最好为20A。在岛上很难快速找到Zigbee开关，我从[中国](https://vi.aliexpress.com/item/1005006833309900.html)订购，大约花费20欧元。",
  "The first and most important automation is to turn off the button N minutes after any activation. We set it up and no longer think about whether you forgot to turn off the button or whether it has been working for the third day. An example of automation for Home Assistant, you need to replace it with your `device_id` and `entity_id`:": "第一个也是最重要的自动化是在任何激活后N分钟关闭按钮。我们设置好后就不再考虑是否忘记关闭按钮或者它已经连续工作了第三天。一个Home Assistant的自动化示例，您需要用您的`device_id`和`entity_id`替换它：",
  "You can change the time throughout the year. For example, in February I need to heat the water for an hour, and in April 30 minutes is enough. Something useful is to add sending a notification to your phone when the water is heated.": "您可以根据一年中的时间更改时间。例如，我需要在二月加热水一个小时，在四月30分钟就足够了。有用的是在水加热时向您的手机发送通知。",
  "## IR Remote Controls for Air Conditioners and TV": "## 空调和电视的红外遥控器",
  "Remote controls come with Wi-Fi connection (require constant power) and Zigbee connection (battery operated).": "遥控器带有Wi-Fi连接（需要持续电源）和Zigbee连接（电池操作）。",
  "The Wi-Fi option I tried was from the manufacturer [Broadlink](https://www.ibroadlink.com/productinfo/762674.html), bought on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/dp/B07ZSG9Y67/), about €30. For the initial setup, you will have to install their application on your phone and create an account, but after that the IR remote control will work on the local network, connecting to HA is done using [integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/broadlink/). To further customize the remote control to suit your needs, I recommend looking at the [SmartIR](https://github.com/smartHomeHub/SmartIR) repository - this is a large library of ready-made commands for different air conditioners and TVs.": "我尝试过的Wi-Fi选项来自制造商[Broadlink](https://www.ibroadlink.com/productinfo/762674.html)，在[Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/dp/B07ZSG9Y67/)购买，大约30欧元。初始设置时，您需要在手机上安装他们的应用程序并创建一个帐户，但之后红外遥控器将在本地网络上工作，连接到HA是通过[集成](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/broadlink/)完成的。为了进一步定制遥控器以适应您的需求，我建议查看[SmartIR](https://github.com/smartHomeHub/SmartIR)存储库 - 这是一个为不同空调和电视准备的大型命令库。",
  "Tip": "提示",
  "If your specific A/C model is not found, try other models from the same manufacturer. The commands will probably be the same and you will be able to connect your A/C.": "如果找不到您特定的空调型号，请尝试同一制造商的其他型号。命令可能是相同的，您将能够连接您的空调。",
  "Remote controls running on Zigbee do not require a constant connection to power, but run on batteries. On the one hand, this is a plus, because you can place the device in any convenient place in the room. On the other hand, the batteries will need to be changed as needed. The setup process for such remote controls may also differ from Broadlink. If you can’t use the SmartIR library, the remote control will need to be trained for each command separately and saved in the Home Assistant configuration.": "运行在Zigbee���的遥控器不需要与电源保持持续连接，而是使用电池。一方面，这是一个优点，因为您可以将设备放在房间中的任何方便位置。另一方面，电池需要根据需要更换。这类遥控器的设置过程也可能与Broadlink不同。如果无法使用SmartIR库，则需要为每个命令单独训练遥控器，并保存在Home Assistant配置中。",
  "Programmable remote controls are very easy to install and configure; they do not require wall mounting or connection to an air conditioner bus. However, there is a slight limitation due to the lack of feedback between devices. We cannot verify that the A/C has turned on and is executing exactly the command that we sent. However, we do it quickly and without damage to the apartment. To give a little more information to the remote control, you can install any Zigbee temperature and humidity sensor, for example [this one](https://vi.aliexpress.com/item/1005005595631552.html) for €10, and link the readings to the remote control. This way we have simple feedback, and the number of interesting scenarios increases.": "可编程遥控器非常容易安装和配置；它们不需要壁挂或连接到空调总线。但是，由于设备之间缺乏反馈，存在轻微限制。我们无法验证空调是否已打开并准确执行我们发送的命令。但是，我们可以快速完成操作，而不会损坏公寓。为了为遥控器提供更多信息，您可以安装任何Zigbee温度和湿度传感器，例如[这个](https://vi.aliexpress.com/item/1005005595631552.html)售价10欧元，并将读数链接到遥控器。这样我们就有了简单的反馈，有趣的场景数量也增加了。",
  "## Energy Meter": "## 能源计量器",
  "There are semi-invasive meters for electricity consumption, such as the one in the image below:": "有半侵入式的电力消耗计量器，如下图所示：",
  "They must be powered by applying L and N to the input. On the other side, an induction ring is connected to the meter, which we hang on a phase or consumption line for measurement. Most houses and apartments have 3 phases, which means you need to install 3 such modules. I bought it on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B0C37DJXVD/) for €60, one for each phase. Older homes may only have one phase.": "它们必须通���将L和N连接到输入来供电。另一边，感应环连接到电表上，我们将其挂在一个相位或消耗线上进行测量。大多数房屋和公寓有3个相位，这意味着您需要安装3个这样的模块。我在[Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B0C37DJXVD/)上以60欧元购买了一个，每个相位一个。老房子可能只有一个相位。",
  "## Conclusion": "## 结论",
  "For me, a smart home is not a luxury, but a necessity. This is a place where I want to relax and spend time with my family, without wasting energy on solving everyday issues. The cost of the above kit in my case was about €500 and a couple of evenings. The result is invaluable!": "对我来说，智能家居不是奢侈，而是必需品。这是我想要放松并与家人共度时光的地方，而不是浪费精力解决日常问题。在我这种情况下，上述套件的成本约为500欧元，加上几个晚上。结果是无价的！"
